JD vs. Walt
-----------

* make structure
	* We want a structure that allows us to build and flexibly rebuild a database
	* Use "semaphore" files that signal whether a particular database is up-to-date wrt a particular "chunk" of data
		* a semaphore is like a phony target that exists

* What's good about sqlite?
	* vs. doing everything in R
	* keyword: tidyverse (start with dplyr introduction maybe)

* What's good about SQL?
	* vs. filtering and pipes

* sqlite vs sq"heavy" (MySQL)
	* simpler (a library that you link against your program
	* heavy things are needed for security, multi-user â€¦

* caching

* JD R rules

* WM to do:
	* learn about tidyverse/dplyr
	* how good is tbl for indexing?
	* how hard is it to export/import sql databases from R?
	* Work on chunking and rebuilding DC's stuff
